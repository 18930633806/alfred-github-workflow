GitHub Workflow for Alfred 2
============================

It works almost like the [GitHub command bar](https://github.com/blog/1264-introducing-the-command-bar), the keyword is "gh" (example: `gh github/gollum issues`).

There are some additional workflow specific commands, they begin with `>`:

* `gh > login <user>`
* `gh > logout`
* `gh > delete cache`
* `gh > update`
* `gh > activate autoupdate`
* `gh > deactivate autoupdate`

You have to login before you can use the workflow. The login command opens a dialog box for the password. The workflow does not save the plain password, only a cookie for the login.
