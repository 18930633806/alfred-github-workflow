GitHub Workflow for Alfred 2
============================

It works almost like the [GitHub command bar](https://github.com/blog/1264-introducing-the-command-bar), the keyword is "gh" (example: `gh github/gollum issues`).

At first you need to login by `gh > login <user>`, it opens a dialog box for the password. The workflow does not save the plain password, only a cookie for the login.
(There are two more workflow specific commands: `gh > logout` and `gh > delete cache`.)
